# Income-Classification-ML

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year using census data. Two models, Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest Classification, are implemented using optimal strategies for dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation. The project showcases experimental results and provides instructions for replicating the analysis.
