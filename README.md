# Income-Classification-ML

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year using census data. Two models, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest Classification, are implemented using optimal strategies for dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation. The project showcases experimental results and provides instructions for replicating the analysis.

Dataset - The dataset (‘Census Income’) has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)
